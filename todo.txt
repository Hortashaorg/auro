CLEANUP:
Standardize JSDoc Format
    Create a consistent format for component documentation
    Include features, examples, and explanations
    Make sure all components are properly documented
Implement a Component Composition Pattern
    Create more composable patterns for complex components
    For example, a FormGroup that wraps FormControl + Label + Input
    This would reduce boilerplate in component consumers
Handle Props and TypeScript Intellisense
    Improve the approach to component props
    Currently using JSX.IntrinsicElements which shows too many props
    Create more specific prop interfaces that extend HTML element props
    Focus on making important props prominent in intellisense
Event Naming Conventions
    Standardize event naming across all components
    For example: form-error, form-input, form-clear
    Create a consistent pattern for all component events
Default Values and Behavior Configuration
    Consider a configuration system for library-wide defaults
    Allow overrides at various levels
Update ai.md Documentation
    Update the component organization section to reflect new structure
    Document the component library patterns and best practices
    Include examples of component composition
