# Component Rules

- Not include any business logic
- Define style variants with class-variance-authority
- Use TypeScript for prop types
- Use the `cn()` utility for class merging
- Follow a single responsibility principle
- Be properly exported with clear, descriptive names
- Components should not include HTMX specific logic.
- Pass framework-specific attributes through props
- Use class-variance-authority (cva) for component variants
- Implement dark mode support through Tailwind classes
- Follow consistent variant naming across components:
  - size: sm/md/lg
  - variant: primary/secondary/outline/danger
  - state: default/error
