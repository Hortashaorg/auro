# Component Overview

Review this guide to understand the available UI components, their classification (Atoms, Molecules, etc.), and their intended use. Familiarize yourself with existing components before creating new ones to promote consistency and reuse.

### Molecules vs Atoms

- A component is an **Atom** if it renders a single primary HTML element, acting as a basic visual building block (e.g., `<button>`, `<img>`, `<input>`) or a simple structural wrapper (e.g., a `<div>` for layout like `CardBody` or `ButtonGroup`).
- A component is a **Molecule** if it combines multiple elements to form a distinct functional unit. Specifically, it's a Molecule if:
    - It renders **one or more Atom** components internally, OR
    - It renders **two or more distinct HTML elements** as part of its core structure (not just simple wrappers passed via `children`).
