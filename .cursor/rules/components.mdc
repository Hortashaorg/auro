# Component Overview

Review this guide to understand the available UI components, their classification (Atoms, Molecules, etc.), and their intended use. Familiarize yourself with existing components before creating new ones to promote consistency and reuse.

### Molecules vs Atoms

*   A component is an **Atom** if it renders a single primary HTML element, acting as a basic visual building block (e.g., `<button>`, `<img>`, `<input>`) or a simple structural wrapper (e.g., a `<div>` for layout like `CardBody` or `ButtonGroup`).
*   A component is a **Molecule** if it combines multiple elements to form a distinct functional unit. Specifically, it's a Molecule if:
    *   It renders **one or more Atom** components internally, OR
    *   It renders **two or more distinct HTML elements** as part of its core structure (not just simple wrappers passed via `children`).

## Atoms

- Buttons:
    - `@comp/atoms/buttons/Button.tsx`: Standard button element. Variants: visual styles, sizes.
    - `@comp/atoms/buttons/Link.tsx`: Styled `<a>` tag for navigation. Variants: navLink, dropdownLink.
    - `@comp/atoms/buttons/ButtonLink.tsx`: `<a>` tag styled like a Button.
    - `@comp/atoms/buttons/ButtonGroup.tsx`: `<div>` for grouping/spacing buttons.
    - `@comp/atoms/buttons/index.ts`: All buttons can be imported from here.
- Image:
    - `@comp/atoms/image/Image.tsx`: Standard button element. Variants: visual styles, sizes.
    - `@comp/atoms/image/index.ts`: All image components can be imported from here.
- Cards:
    - `@comp/atoms/card/Card.tsx`: Standard card.
    - `@comp/atoms/card/CardBody.tsx`: Creates vertical space between elements in the card.
    - `@comp/atoms/card/index.ts`: All card atoms can be imported from here.
- Typography:
    - `@comp/atoms/typography/Badge.tsx`: Renders a badge element, often used for counts or status indicators.
    - `@comp/atoms/typography/Text.tsx`: Renders text content (e.g., paragraph, span). Variants likely control size, weight, color.
    - `@comp/atoms/typography/index.ts`: All typography atoms can be imported from here.
- Tabs:
    - `@comp/atoms/tabs/Tabs.tsx`: Wrapper for correct Tab behavior.
    - `@comp/atoms/tabs/TabsList.tsx`: Container for grouping `TabsTrigger` components.
    - `@comp/atoms/tabs/TabsTrigger.tsx`: The clickable button/trigger for switching tabs.
    - `@comp/atoms/tabs/TabContent.tsx`: The content panel associated with a specific tab.
    - `@comp/atoms/tabs/index.ts`: All tab atoms can be imported from here.

## Molecules

- Cards:
    - `@comp/molecules/card/MediaCardHeader.tsx`: Takes small picture, title and description to display on header of card.
    - `@comp/molecules/card/index.ts`: All card molecules can be imported from here.
- Modals:
    - `@comp/molecules/modal/Modal.tsx`: Renders the main dialog structure with title, content area, and close functionality.
    - `@comp/molecules/modal/ModalButton.tsx`: A button specifically styled and configured to trigger the display of a Modal.
    - `@comp/molecules/modal/index.ts`: Exports all modal molecules.
