# Event Naming Conventions

This document outlines the naming convention for custom events used within the application, particularly those defined in `services/app/components/utils/events.ts`. Consistency in event naming helps improve code readability and maintainability.

## Convention

Events should be named using **kebab-case** and follow the pattern:

`[scope/subject]-[action/state]`

-   **`scope/subject`**: (Required) The primary entity, component, or context the event relates to.
    -   *Examples:* `dialog`, `form`, `toast`, `user-profile`, `data-table`
-   **`action/state`**: (Required) The specific action that occurred or the state being signaled.
    -   *Examples:* `open`, `close`, `submit`, `clear`, `update`, `error`, `success`, `show`, `hide`, `select`, `change`

## Examples
- `dialog-close`
- `form-clear`
- `form-error`
- `toast-show`

## Usage

When creating new events in `events.ts` or dispatching events from components, adhere to this convention.
