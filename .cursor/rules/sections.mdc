# Section Rules

- Sections should always have a unique ID for HTMX targeting
- IDs should be descriptive and follow kebab-case naming convention
- Sections that may be re-rendered via HTMX should use consistent IDs
- Multiple instances of the same section type should append a unique identifier
- Section IDs should match their HTMX target selectors.
- The use of sections in this way is the enforce the pattern of rerendring a section after a change have been submitted to the server.
