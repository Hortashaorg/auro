# Page rules

- Pages should consist of components.
- Use components over native html.
- Most styling should be happening on the component level
- Every page should define its own route
- Routes has permissions defined. Nice if these are reusable across multiple pages.
- Can contain buisness logic or use buisness logic functions.
