 # Route Rules

## Route Registration
- All routes must be registered in `services/app/main.ts`
- Export routes with descriptive names ending in `Route` (e.g., `createLocationRoute`)
- Use `createRoute` from `@kalena/framework` to define routes

## Route Structure
- Place page routes in `services/app/pages/`
- Place API routes in `services/app/api/`
- Follow the URL structure in the file path (e.g., `/servers/:serverId/actions` â†’ `pages/server/admin/actions.tsx`)

## Route Configuration
- Always define permissions using the `permission` field
- Set `partial: true` for HTMX API endpoints
- Set `partial: false` for full page routes
- Use `formValidationSchema` for form handling routes
- Set `hmr: Deno.env.get("ENV") === "local"` for development

## Route Components
- Page routes should use the `Layout` component
- API routes should return HTMX compatible responses
- Use `route.context()` to access route parameters and validation
- Handle form validation errors with `form-error` events
