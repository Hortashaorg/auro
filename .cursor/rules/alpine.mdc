# Alpine.js State Management Rules

- Each page has its own Alpine.js state scope through the Layout component
- Additional x-data scopes can be added for component-specific state
- Modal components must share state scope with their triggers
- Use x-cloak for managing initial element visibility
- Follow consistent x-data scoping patterns
- Implement state transitions with x-show
- Keep Alpine.js logic minimal and focused
