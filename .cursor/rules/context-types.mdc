# Context Types in the Framework

There are three main types of contexts available in routes:

## 1. getGlobalContext()
- Base Hono context containing request/response objects
- Contains global variables like `email` from authentication
- Available in all routes
- Example usage: `const email = getGlobalContext().var.email`

## 2. route.context()
- Extends global context with route-specific features
- Includes form validation via `req.valid()`
- Includes header management via `header()`
- Example usage:
```ts
const context = myRoute.context();
const formData = context.req.valid("form");
```

## 3. route.customContext()
- User-defined context specific to each route
- Typically used for data fetching and authorization
- Must be defined in route configuration
- Example usage:
```ts
export const myRoute = createRoute({
    customContext: async (c) => {
        const account = await db.query.account.findFirst({
            where: (account, { eq }) => eq(account.email, c.var.email),
        });
        return { account };
    }
});
// In component:
const { account } = await myRoute.customContext();
```
