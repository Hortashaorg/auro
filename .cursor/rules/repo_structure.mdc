# Repository Structure Overview

This document outlines the main directories and their purpose within the project.

## Top-Level Directories

- `packages/`: Contains reusable libraries or modules shared across different services or applications within the monorepo (if applicable).
- `services/`: Houses the distinct applications or microservices of the project. The main web application resides here.
- `scripts/`: Holds utility scripts for development, building, deployment, etc.
- `.devcontainer/`: Configuration for the development container environment.

## Main Application (`services/app/`)

The primary web application code lives within `services/app/`. Key subdirectories include:

- `components/`: Contains reusable UI components following an Atomic Design methodology.
    - Organized into `atoms/` and `molecules/`.
    - Refer to `components.mdc` for detailed component classification and usage guidelines.
- `sections/`: UI fragments designed to be potentially re-rendered or swapped via HTMX actions. Often composed of multiple components.
- `pages/`: Defines the main page routes for the application, rendering initial layouts and composing sections and components.
- `api/`: Contains server-side endpoints, particularly those handling HTMX requests and returning HTML fragments or handling form submissions.
- `public/`: Static assets served directly by the web server (e.g., images, client-side JS libraries like `darkmode.js` or `favicon.ico`).
- `permissions/`: Logic related to user permissions and authorization (inferred from imports like `@permissions/index.ts`).

**Goal:** Maintain a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to locate code, understand responsibilities, and manage the different parts of the application and the overall project.
